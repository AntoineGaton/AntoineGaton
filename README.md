## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Experience

### **Software Engineer | TD Bank | 2022 - Present**
In my current role at TD Bank, I work on enhancing and maintaining mainframe applications, focusing on improving performance and reliability. I've collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop secure APIs, debug existing codebases, and participate in Agile development processes. My work here has directly contributed to a 20% improvement in application performance and a 25% boost in system reliability.

### **Technical Projects**
- **[A Pet Nose Best Website](https://github.com/AntoineGaton/A-Pet-Nose-Best-Site)**: Developed a website for my fianc√©e's dog-walking business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases her services, provides client testimonials, and allows users to book appointments directly online.
- **A Pet Nose Best Mobile App**: Created a mobile app using Flutter for my fianc√©e's business. The app enables clients to track, communicate, and book appointments for services. I plan to evolve this project into a SaaS platform that other dog walkers can subscribe to and use with their clients.
- **[Private Wall](https://github.com/AntoineGaton/Python/tree/master/PrivateWall)**: Developed a secure Flask/MySQL application where users can manage their private messages, utilizing BCrypt for password encryption and Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Invoice Automation App**: Built a React/Electron-based application that automates the creation of invoices for clients, using DocxGenerator to generate dynamic DOCX files. The app streamlines invoicing processes by allowing users to input information and automatically generate ready-to-use documents.

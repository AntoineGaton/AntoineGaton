# 🐵 Antoine Gaton

**`Full-Stack Developer`**

I am a young software engineer with knowledge of many different front-end and back-end languages, responsive frameworks, and databases. Currently, I am a teacher assistant at the Bootcamp I graduated from, Coding Dojo. As a TA I am constantly improving upon my skills and discovering new technologies and frameworks in pursuit of becoming a well-rounded developer. Never been on to journal or keep a diary but my gitHub is the closest representation of that and my journey through computer science.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Antoine's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   If you are reading this...thanks! This hidden section is my cave painting. Where I can reflect and share where I came from and where I am going as a developer. My coding journey really started the day I first touched a keyboard but when the universe really jolted me onto this path is when the pandemic occured. As a nursing student in the last semester and ready to set his career in the medical field the pandemic was a real eye opener. As a person who is immunocompromised it was difficult doing long shift at the hospital and wondering about my safety and health. That's when I started reassing and wondering if that was the right path for me in the long run...
